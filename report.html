  <h2>Kennedy O'Hanley's website - The Jeep Yard</h2>

  <p>Link to PDF Sketch</p>

  <h4>1. Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should
    be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
    report.html does not count toward the five, but index.html does.</h4>
  <p>I have included 6 pages: Home, About Us, Photos, Reviews, A form for requesting parts, and a contact page. The Home
    page is named index. Each page is able to be reached from every other page, and each page has a clear purpose.</p>
  <h4>2. Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).</h4>
  <p>I have created an image with "TJY", and have included it on each page of the site.</p>
  <h4>3. Your site must include some sort of header.</h4>
  <p>Each page has a header of the title of that page, with some pages including subtext within the header as well.</p>
  <h4>4. Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</h4>
  <p>Each page includes links to go to any page on the site.</p>
  <h4>
    5. Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where
    you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching
    blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).
  </h4>
  <p>When on a smart phone, the index page switches to a column flex box, so the photos appear above the contact information. The navigation links for each page are also switched, and displayed vertically instead of horrizontally. The about page is also switched so the photo appears above the bio.</p>
  <h4>
    6. Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen
    readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
  </h4>
  <p>There are photos displayed on the home page, about page, and a page specifically dedicated to photos. Each picture has alt text describing the image.</p>
  Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu ValidatorLinks to an
  external site. and WAVE Web Accessibility EvaluatorLinks to an external site..
  Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph
  copy in a serif font.
  Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be
  present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
  Your site must include links to external sites.
  Your site must be available at https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-s23-p1
    In https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-s23-p1/report.html, write a brief report
      containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above, and linking to the
      PDF of your design sketch.</p>
