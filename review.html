      <p><i>"Absolutely the best customer service I have ever gotten anywhere. They go absolutely above and beyond
          trying to assist you with your needs. Excellent two way communication, friendly, faster shipping than
          Amazon ( I'm referring to 2 day shipping Amazon), the parts I got were exactly as described! I cannot
          give them enough praise. Keep up the great work! I can't wait to come down in person and see everything
          available. Anyone that owns a jeep knows your always looking for parts whether their an upgrade,
          replacement, etc. I would absolutely check with the jeep yard first. They'll save you a lot of time and
          money! Which means more time to spend on installs and more money to spend on parts!
          Thanks again!"</i></p>

          Tyler is an awesome dude, parts are priced accordingly and fairly. Very astute with his responses, very
          professional, most information you need to know or want to know he will gladly provide. conducted
          business with him a couple times, every time has been easy and simple. Definitely recommend this guy for
          Jeep parts."</i></p>

      <p><i>"One the best places to go for jeep parts, and worth the drive. Tyler knows what he's talking about,
          there's a little bit of everything there that you could possibly need for a Jeep, fair on prices.
          Definitely will be back."</i></p>

      <p><i>"Anything you might need to help fix up your Jeep. Tyler is a super nice guy. We needed a spare tire and rim
          . We called him and he was leaving but came back and helped us and even helped pull off another Jeep. Great
          prices too! Highly recommended"</i></p>

      <p><i>"Great guy, knows his stuff about jeeps and insured and proved to me the part I was buying worked before
          buying it. Will definitely keep him in mind for future jeep parts and help. He also does this as a one man
          operation so don't have to worry about talking to multiple people and getting multiple answers. Definitely
          recommend"</i></p>
